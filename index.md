My name is Pai Buabthong 
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Division of Applied Physics and Materials Science at California Institute of Technology, 
working with [Prof. Nathan S. Lewis](http://nsl.caltech.edu/) in 
[the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP)](https://solarfuelshub.org/). 
My [research](/research) focuses on [corrosion of semiconductors](/research#corrosion) and [protective coating](/research#coating) 
for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting devices.

Previously, I studied physics with a minor in mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
where I worked under Prof. Eugene Colla on temperature-dependence of ferroelectric properties in lead zirconate titanate.

I've spent a summer at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory under the Lee Teng undergraduate fellowship 
to work on [an interferometric residual phase noise measurement](/research#interferometric-phase-noise-measurement).

In the summer of 2018, I interned at Lam Research Corp., to develop [high dielectric coating](/research#high-dielectric-breakdown-coating) 
for plasma etcher's electrostatic chucks
